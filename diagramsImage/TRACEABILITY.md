# üß© CR1 Traceability Matrix ‚Äì Issues ‚Üî UML Diagrams

This table maps the 32 user stories (GitHub issues) from the *Population Reporting System*
to their corresponding UML design diagrams.  
Each issue corresponds to one or more **use cases**, **activity**, **sequence**, or **class** diagrams.

## üèÅ Notes for Review

- Each issue from GitHub maps to at least one UML element.
- The design reflects both data structure (`world.sql`) and logic flow.
- Sequence diagrams correspond to Java DAO methods implemented in later stages.
- This matrix ensures *full traceability* between requirements and design.
